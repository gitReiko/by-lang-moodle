        will give a Moodle Grade of 100%. Grades may be as high as 300% if every question is correct with C=3
       (high certainty). Simple Moodle Grades with CBM are not easily compared with Grades without CBM,
        unless converted to CB Grades (below).

**Accuracy** is the percentage correct, ignoring certainty but weighted with the max values assigned to each question.
        If the student successfully distinguishes more and less reliable answers, this is reflected in a **CB Bonus**,
        which  is positive if the total marks are higher than could be obtained with the same answers at uniform certainty.
        The **CB Accuracy** (=Accuracy + Bonus) is the clearest measure of knowledge. The **CB Grade** is the
        CB Accuracy multiplied by the maximum grade assigned to the quiz.';
