Use this course import plugin to import user enrollments from a delimited text
file into the course. New user accounts will not be created, so each of the
users listed in the input file must already have an account set up in the site.<br />
<br />
If a group name is include with any user record (line) then that user will be
added to that group if it exists. You can optionally create new groups if needed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each line of the import file represents a signle record</li>
  <li>Each record should at least contain one field with a userid value, whether it be a username, an e-mail address, or an internal idnumber.</li>
  <li>Each record may contain an additional group name field, separated by a comma, semi-colon, or tab character.</li>
  <li>The role to which these users are assigned can be selected, but should default to the course\'s default role.</li>
  <li>Any, or none, of the fields can be quoted, and the group name field will need to be if it contains a semi-colon or comma</li>
  <li>Blank lines in the import file will be skipped</li>
  <li>Note: If a user is already enrolled in the course, no changes will be made to that user\'s enrollment (i.e. no role change).</li>
</ul>

<p>
A note about metacourses: this plugin will not import user enrollments into a
metacourse, as the enrollment should be made in one of the child courses. It
will, however, make group assignments, and create groups if needed, when the
userid specified is already associated with the metacourse via a child course
enrollment.
