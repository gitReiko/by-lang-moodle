$string['choosereadme'] = '<p><span style=\'font-size: x-large;\'><strong>Lagomorph Theme</strong></span></p><p>This theme has been devloped to provide a basis for a single theme across a wide variety of screen sizes, from full desktop down to mobile phone, although the prime focus is intended to be on flexibility onto mobile devices, such as android tablets/iPad etc.</p>
<p>To achieve this the theme relies considerably on css3 and so <em><strong>IS NOT SUITABLE</strong></em> for older browsers, especially \'older\' IE variations. MS filters have been used to replicate some standard css3 features as near as possible to attempt to give a similar user experience, although some have not proved practical (e.g. there is no gradient on the block headers in IE as I have been unable to make the gradient filter allow for the rounded corners)</p>
<p><strong>Points to note:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1</strong>. The page layout uses \'@media screen\' calls and is based on Daniel Wahl\'s work on the ReBase theme. This allows the page to automatically adjust between 3 column (for larger screen widths), 2 columns (left/main) for smaller screens and a single column where the side-blocks appear under the main content on the smallest screens. The profile block is also adapted according to screen size - showing the profile pic on large screens, but only the username on smaller screens</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>. The main menu for the theme is a single menu bar (ie no dropdowns), populated from a text file which can be loaded via the theme\'s settings page. This menu automatically adjusts to become a dropdown select style menu on smaller screens, and resizes to make it usable by touch control on very small screens. The standard moodle2 custommenu can also be added from an option on the theme\'s settings page, although this is currently set not to be shown on small screens, particularly as the hover style drop downs used are not suitable for touch control.</p>
<p><strong>3</strong>. To reduce the download times and html calls on mobile devices, css gradients/shadows/rounded corners/etc. and very few graphics have been used to create the theme. Those that are included (main picture top right, and block header icons) on larger screens are removed on the smallest layouts. this is based on the assumption that full screen use is more likely to be wired/wireless ethernet based, while smaller devices become more likely to rely on mobile broadband services</p>
<p><strong>4</strong>. I new icon set has been applied, based on the fugue icon set by Yusuke Kamiyamane. The fugue icon set is released under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence. This has been done to try to improve the general look and feel and has no bearing on the theme\'s usefulness in a mobile environment! :) Where these icons have been used to decorate block headers, they are removed on smaller screen sizes where the site may be being accessed over mobile broadband services in order to reduce page download times.</p>
<p><strong>5</strong>. As a design idea that arose during discussions for Shaun Daubney\'s new Aardvark2.1 theme, I have included new block areas, 2 above the main content and 2 below in the center column. This allows greater flexibility in the arrangement of the page and also allows the option for important blocks to be positioned above the main content even when the site is reduced to a single column on the smallest screens.</p>
