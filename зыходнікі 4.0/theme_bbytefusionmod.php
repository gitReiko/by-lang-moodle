		<h2>About</h2>

		<h2>Parents</h2>
		<p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you wish to modify aspects of this theme beyond the settings offered, we advise creating a new  theme using this theme, Base and Canvas all as parents so updates to any of those themes in the core will find their way into your new theme.</p>
