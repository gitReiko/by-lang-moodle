<h3>About</h3>
<p>Decaf is a three-column, fluid-width theme for Moodle that was created by <a href="http://moodle.org/user/view.php?id=390408">Lei Zhang</a>.
It improves usability by shifting setting blocks to top of the page, so called "Moodle awesome bar".
For developers, It transfers the performance info into a colorful floated bar at bottom of the page, which brings the performance awareness as well as improves usability.</p>
<h3>Parents</h3>
<p>This theme is based upon the Bootstrap theme, which was created for Moodle 2.5, with the help of:<br>
Stuart Lamour, Mark Aberdour, Paul Hibbitts, Mary Evans.</p>
<h3>Theme Credits</h3>
<p>Authors: Paul Nicholls, Lei Zhang</p>
