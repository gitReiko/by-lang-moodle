the "Show reports in reports block" checkbox.  Until this checkbox is checked,
the report will not be shown to students.  This allows you to edit the report
before releasing it to students.  The block on the course home page where instructors
edit the email feedback template is used to show links to the feedback reports
to students.  The block is labeled "Quiz Feedback Reports" when viewed by a
student.  The block will only be displayed to students when there is at least one report available.
This block is labeled "Feedback Manager" when viewed by instructors.</p>

<p>Typical student responses can be shown in the report either before or after
the instructor\'s feedback.  If students were instructed to ask a question as their
open-ended response, then
placing the student above the feedback makes the feedback appear as an answer
to the question.</p>
