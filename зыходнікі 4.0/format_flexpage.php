$string['actionbar_help'] = '<p>With Flexpage, course designers can create multiple flexpages within the course. Each flexpage can have unique or shared content on them.</p>

<p>With the Action bar, one can jump to different flexpages within this course by clicking the name of the flexpage in the
 drop-down menu.</p>

<p>Available actions under the <strong>Add</strong> Action bar menu item:
    <ul>
        <li>To add a flexpage, select the <strong>Add flexpages</strong> link from the drop-down menu. When you add new flexpages
        , you will want to determine where they are located in the index of flexpages. Flexpages can be children of other flexpages (sub-flexpages). Or they can simply be placed before or after other flexpages. New flexpages can also be blank, or a copy of an existing flexpage. To add multiple flexpages to a course, press the "+" icon on the right side of the <strong>Add flexpages</strong> window.</li>
        <li>To add a new activity to this flexpage, select <strong>Add activity</strong> from the drop-down menu.  Choose where
         you would like to place the new activity on the flexpage by selecting one of the buttons at the top of the <strong>Add activity</strong> window. Next, choose the activity or resource that you would like to add to the course and flexpage.</li>
        <li>To add an existing activity to this flexpage, select <strong>Add existing activity</strong> from the drop-down menu.
        Choose where you would like to place the existing activity on the flexpage by selecting one of the buttons at the top of the <strong>Add existing activity</strong> window. Next, place a checkmark next to the activities that you would like to add to this flexpage. Finally, click the "Add activities" button at the bottom of the window to complete the action.</li>
        <li>To add a block to this flexpage, select <strong>Add block</strong> from the drop-down menu. Choose where you would
        like to place the block on the flexpage by selecting one of the buttons at the top of the <strong>Add block</strong> window. Next, click on the name of the block that you would like to add to the course.</li>
        <li>To add an existing menu to this flexpage, select <strong>Add existing menu</strong> from the drop-down menu. Choose
         where you would like to place the block on the flexpage by selecting one of the buttons at the top of the <strong>Add existing menu</strong> window. Next, click on the name of the menu that you would like to add to the course.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Available actions under the <strong>Manage</strong> Action bar menu item:
    <ul>
        <li>To configure the settings for this flexpage, click the <strong>Manage flexpage settings</strong> link from the
        drop-down menu. From this window, you can edit the flexpage name; change the widths of the flexpage regions; indicate whether the flexpage should be hidden, visible, or visible in menus; as well as determine whether the flexpages should have "previous and next" navigation buttons.</li>
        <li>To move a flexpage, click the <strong>Move flexpage</strong> link from the drop-down menu. From this window, you can
         choose whether the flexpage is a child of another flexpage, or whether it is before or after another flexpage in the index.</li>
        <li>To delete a flexpage, click the <strong>Delete flexpage</strong> link from the drop-down menu. From this window, you
        can confirm that you want to delete the current flexpage.</li>
        <li>To manage the settings of multiple flexpages, click the <strong>Manage all flexpages</strong> link from the drop-down
         menu. From this window, you can view the index of all flexpages; quickly manage, move or delete individual flexpages; alter display settings; as well as control navigation settings.</li>
        <li>To manage tabs for your course, as well as other menus, click the <strong>Manage all menus</strong> link from the
        drop-down menu. From this window you can create menus, as well as quickly edit menus, delete menus, and manage links within the menus.</li>
